;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Render unstaged/staged changes in the `magit-status' buffer using
;; difftastic, while keeping them as collapsible, navigable Magit sections.
;;
;; The package provides `magit-difftastic-mode', a global minor mode.  When
;; enabled it overrides Magit's stock unstaged/staged section inserters so the
;; status buffer shows difftastic-rendered, per-file, per-chunk sections, and
;; advises Magit's stage/unstage/discard/visit commands so they operate on the
;; difftastic chunk (or selected region) at point.  When the mode is off,
;; Magit's stock sections are used, so you can always fall back.
;;
;; Section visibility mirrors Magit: a file section starts collapsed in the
;; `magit-status' buffer (and for deleted files everywhere) and expanded in the
;; diff/revision buffers, while the per-chunk sections always start expanded --
;; so expanding a file reveals its hunk(s), the same way a single-hunk file
;; feels like it expands straight to its diff in stock Magit.
;;
;; The same difftastic chunks are also rendered in `magit-diff-mode' buffers --
;; which includes the diff Magit shows while you compose a commit message -- and
;; in `magit-revision-mode' buffers (viewing a commit), by advising Magit's
;; `magit-insert-diff'/`magit-insert-revision-diff'.  Per-chunk (and region)
;; staging is offered only where it is meaningful: the worktree (unstaged) and
;; `--cached' (staged) diffs.  Diffs that merely compare two revisions (a range
;; diff, or a commit being viewed) are rendered display-only.  These two
;; integrations can be scoped with `magit-difftastic-diff-buffers' and
;; `magit-difftastic-revision-buffers' (both default on); anything difftastic
;; cannot render -- `--no-index' diffs, merge commits shown as combined diffs --
;; falls straight back to Magit's stock rendering.
;;
;; In the side-by-side layouts difft sizes each file's columns to that file's
;; own longest line, so the center divider (and the right-hand line numbers)
;; would otherwise land at a different column per file.  By default
;; (`magit-difftastic-align-columns') every two-column chunk in a buffer is
;; padded so its right column lines up with the widest chunk's, keeping the
;; divider and right-side line numbers aligned across the whole buffer; the
;; padding only widens the gap between the columns, so staging is unaffected.
;;
;; Rendering can also be toggled per file: with point on a file (or chunk),
;; `magit-difftastic-toggle-file-rendering' (bound to
;; `magit-difftastic-toggle-rendering-key', \\`C-c C-d' by default) switches
;; just that file between difftastic and stock Magit rendering, and back.  A
;; file shown with stock Magit sections uses Magit's own per-hunk and per-line
;; staging -- handy when you want fine-grained staging or a file difftastic
;; renders awkwardly.  The choice is buffer-local and survives refreshes.
;;
;; Evil integration is optional and installed gracefully: if `evil' is present
;; the staging keys are bound in the relevant magit maps; if not, nothing is
;; assumed and the package works with stock Emacs keybindings.  Set
;; `magit-difftastic-bind-evil-keys' to nil to opt out of those Evil bindings
;; entirely (e.g. if you remap `s'/`u'/`x' yourself).
;;
;; This package: per-file difftastic sections, split into collapsible per-chunk
;; sub-sections, with both FILE-LEVEL and PER-CHUNK staging.
;;
;;   Each changed file becomes a Magit `file' section.  Its body is the
;;   difftastic-rendered diff, which we split on difftastic's
;;   own `FILE --- N/M --- LANG' chunk headers: those headers are dropped and
;;   each chunk becomes its own collapsible `magit-difftastic-hunk' sub-section with a
;;   minimal, native-looking `@@ line N @@' heading.
;;
;;   On a FILE heading, Magit's commands work at the file level (stage/unstage
;;   via `magit-stage-1 "-u" FILE', purely filename-based):
;;
;;     s / u  -> stage / unstage the whole file
;;     TAB    -> collapse / expand the file (or, on a chunk heading, the chunk)
;;     RET    -> visit the file
;;
;;   On a CHUNK, the same keys act on just that chunk (see the "Per-chunk
;;   staging" section below for how this maps back onto real git hunks).  When
;;   a REGION is active within a chunk, they act on only the selected lines
;;   (see the "Region (line-range) staging" section):
;;
;;     s      -> stage this chunk's change(s) / the selected lines
;;     u      -> unstage this chunk's change(s) / the selected lines
;;     k      -> discard this chunk's worktree change(s) / the selected lines
;;     RET    -> visit the file
;;
;;   Chunk sub-sections are a CUSTOM type (`magit-difftastic-hunk'), deliberately not
;;   Magit's real `hunk' type: real hunk sections trigger Magit's hunk paint
;;   method, which repaints lines by +/- detection and would clobber
;;   difftastic's colours.  Because the custom type is not one Magit's apply
;;   machinery understands -- and because evil-collection-magit makes
;;   `magit-mode-map' an overriding map so a section-keymap `[remap ...]' never
;;   wins -- per-chunk commands are wired by ADVISING the magit commands
;;   themselves (see the "Advice" commentary below), which is binding- and
;;   evil-state-agnostic.
;;
;; KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
;;   - Region staging operates within a single chunk at a time (the chunk at
;;     point); a region spanning multiple chunks/files only affects the chunk
;;     that contains it.  Whole-chunk staging snaps to the underlying git hunk
;;     boundary -- the same boundary Magit's own per-hunk staging uses.
;;   - `difft' is run once per changed file when its content first needs
;;     rendering.  Files in a section are rendered concurrently (up to
;;     `magit-difftastic-render-jobs' processes at a time) and the result is
;;     cached across refreshes keyed on the compared blobs (see
;;     `magit-difftastic-cache'), so an unchanged file is not re-rendered -- a
;;     refresh costs roughly the slowest file that actually changed.  A very
;;     large set of first-time changes can still make `magit-status' sluggish,
;;     since the refresh waits for that initial batch.
;;   - Untracked files are still rendered by the stock
;;     `magit-insert-untracked-files'.
;;   - In `magit-diff-mode'/`magit-revision-mode' buffers the difftastic
;;     rendering replaces Magit's diff section wholesale, so the usual diffstat
;;     header is not shown there.  Merge commits (combined diffs) and
;;     `--no-index' diffs fall back to Magit's stock rendering.
;;   - Whitespace-ignoring diff flags (`-w', `--ignore-blank-lines', ...) are
;;     honoured at FILE granularity: difft has no whitespace-ignore option (and
;;     Git does not pass these to an external diff tool), so a file whose only
;;     differences are whitespace is dropped from the view, but whitespace noise
;;     mixed with real changes inside a (plain-text) file is still shown.  For
;;     recognised languages difft already ignores whitespace structurally.
;;
;; Toggle with `magit-difftastic-mode' (global).  When off, Magit's
;; stock unstaged/staged sections are used, so you can always fall back.

;;; Per-chunk staging
;;
;; Strategy: difftastic is DISPLAY only.  Git's own unified diff remains the
;; source of truth for the patch we apply, so every applied patch is a valid
;; git patch.  To stage "the chunk at point" we:
;;
;;   1. read the chunk's (file, index, staged) -- stored on the section value;
;;   2. lazily run `difft --display json' for that file to get the chunk's
;;      exact old/new line numbers (lhs/rhs, 0-indexed -> +1);
;;   3. run `git diff --no-ext-diff -U1' to get fine-grained hunks (one context
;;      line), each with its line ranges and exact patch text;
;;   4. select the git hunk(s) overlapping the chunk's line numbers;
;;   5. apply that mini-patch with `git apply [--cached] [--reverse]'.
;;
;; Why one context line (`magit-difftastic-apply-context', default 1) rather
;; than zero?  Zero-context patches REVERSE-apply ambiguously: git cannot tell
;; where to re-insert a deleted line without a neighbouring context line, so
;; unstage/discard of a pure deletion lands in the wrong place.  A single
;; context line disambiguates application (forward AND reverse) while still
;; keeping changes in separate hunks unless they are within two lines of each
;; other.  When several difftastic chunks fall inside one git hunk, staging any

sections instead of difftastic chunks (toggle per file with
`magit-difftastic-toggle-file-rendering').

Initial visibility mirrors Magit: a file section starts collapsed in
`magit-status-mode' buffers (and for deleted files everywhere), and expanded in
the diff/revision buffers.  The chunk sections are always inserted expanded, so
expanding a file reveals its hunk(s) -- the same way a single-hunk file feels
like it expands straight to its diff in Magit."
  ;; One `--raw' plumbing pass per group resolves, for every changed file: its
  ;; status word/rename source (for the Magit-matching heading and initial
  ;; visibility) AND its old/new blob ids -- which key BOTH the difft render
  ;; cache (the pre-warm below) and the major-mode fontification cache (bound via
  ;; `magit-difftastic--file-ids' so the syntax layer reuses these ids).  Doing

Why bind explicitly instead of relying solely on the command advice?  On a
difftastic chunk the keys `s'/`u' resolve (via `magit-mode-map') to
`magit-stage-files'/`magit-unstage-files' -- whose interactive forms PROMPT for
files -- rather than to the dwim commands we advise; and evil-collection routes
keys differently between states.  Binding `s'/`u'/`x' directly to our commands
in both normal and visual states makes chunk staging and region (line-range)
staging behave identically and predictably.  The bound commands fall back to
the normal magit commands when point is not on a difftastic chunk, so this is
safe even with the mode's other features off.

We bind in both `magit-mode-map' and `magit-section-mode-map' (the latter has
higher precedence as a minor-mode map) so our binding wins regardless of what
evil-collection-magit[-section] puts there.

Binding is gated on `magit-difftastic-bind-evil-keys': we install our commands
only when ENABLE and that option are both non-nil; otherwise the keys are
unbound (falling through to Magit), so users who remap `s'/`u'/`x' can opt out."

  "Render unstaged/staged changes in `magit-status' with difftastic.

While enabled, `magit-insert-unstaged-changes' and
`magit-insert-staged-changes' are overridden so the status buffer shows
collapsible, difftastic-rendered, per-file sections.  `magit-insert-diff' and
`magit-insert-revision-diff' are likewise advised so `magit-diff-mode' buffers
\(including the diff shown while composing a commit) and `magit-revision-mode'
buffers (viewing a commit) get the same difftastic chunks; this can be scoped
with `magit-difftastic-diff-buffers' and `magit-difftastic-revision-buffers'.
The magit stage/unstage/discard/visit commands are advised so that, while point
is on a difftastic chunk, they act on just that chunk (otherwise unchanged) --
staging is offered only where it is meaningful (the worktree and `--cached'
diffs).  Evil normal/visual-state keys are also bound so per-chunk and region
\(line-range) staging work; set `magit-difftastic-bind-evil-keys' to nil to opt
out if you remap those keys yourself.

`magit-difftastic-toggle-rendering-key' is bound on the difftastic and stock
sections to `magit-difftastic-toggle-file-rendering', which switches the file
at point between difftastic and stock Magit rendering (a stock-rendered file
uses Magit's native per-hunk/line staging)."
